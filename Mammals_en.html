<h1>COMMON HEDGEHOG / WHITE-BREASTED HEDGEHOG </h1>
The common hedgehog is a small animal, but in general its size for the entire genus of Eurasian hedgehogs ranges from medium to large. The body length is 23.7—29 cm, the tail is about 14 to 32 mm[5][6] body weight is 700-800 g[7]. The ears are relatively small (usually from 28.5 to 40.1 mm)[5]. Common hedgehogs living in Cyprus have larger ears[8]. The muzzle is elongated. The animal's nose is sharp and constantly moist. Hedgehogs have 20 small sharp teeth on the upper jaw, and 16 on the lower jaw. The upper incisors are widely spaced, leaving room for the bite of the lower incisors. The head is relatively large, wedge-shaped, with a slightly elongated facial region
